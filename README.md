Web Application for Detection of COPD 

A Web Application that can support the detection of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)by medical professionals by uploading the respiratory sound. Technologies Used Angular, Nodejs, Python (for Deep Learning Model)

# Web Application for Detection of COPD  

**AI-powered respiratory sound classifier for early COPD detection**

## 📄 Overview  
This project is a full-stack web application that enables medical professionals to detect Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by uploading a patient’s respiratory sound recording. The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze audio and deliver detection results, packaged with a clean UI built with Angular and a Node.js backend.

## 🚀 Features  

- Upload respiratory sound (audio file) for analysis  
- AI-based sound classification with high accuracy (>90%)  
- Responsive web UI for clean user experience  
- Modular architecture: Frontend + Backend + Model separation  
- Includes project documentation & research paper
